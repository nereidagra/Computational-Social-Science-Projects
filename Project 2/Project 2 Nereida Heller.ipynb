    "\"Bias\" refers to systematic errors that are created when a model tries to approximate real-world phenomena using a model that is too simple or just wrong; e.g. if the real-world relationship is non-linear, a linear model will create a lot of bias. \"Variance\" refers to the errors that are created when noisy data influences a model too much; unlike bias, where the model isn't precise or complex enough, variance means that the model is paying too much attention to the noise in the model and will perform poorly when confronted with a that dataset without the particular idiosyncracies it was trained on. The \"trade-off\" refers to the balance between the two.\n",

    "In our diabetes context, both bias and variance will lead to inaccurate predictions. High bias will lead to a model that predicts outcomes badly, in both the training and test sets. As you correct bias by adjusting the model, it's possible to make the model so sensitive that it picks up idiosyncracies/variance of the training set. At that point, the model will work well with the training set but not the test set. Our model shouldn't be so simple that it ignores things like age, sex, and race; but it can't be so specific that it adjusts itself to the specific dataset that we have available for training. "
