    "Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression aims to find the best-fitting line for a dataset by minimizing the squared differences between observed and predicted values. It assumes (a) a linear relationship between features and the target, with (b) normally distributed residuals that are (c) independent and (d) have constant variance. I think it's worth trying OLS because it's a very simple model, easily understood. We've already checked for multi collinearity, and I have eliminated a lot of the variables to be sure that that's not a problem. The data is not terribly imbalanced. But OLS could be a bad choice if the relationship between the features and our Y turns out not to be linear. I'd like to give it a try anyway, but I have a feeling my other models will fit better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression enhances OLS by adding a penalty that shrinks coefficients in order to prevent overfitting. Ridge keeps all the features but reduces their influence. There are actually a few reasons why Ridge regression might not be the best choice for this dataset: Ridge is good for data that has multicollinearity, and a lot of variables. I've already eliminated a lot of variables from my data set, so using Ridge might be a little inappropriate (even though for someone who's new to machine learning, 30 variables in a regression still seems like a lot!). I think it'll be interesting to go through the exercise of doing the Ridge regression and seeing the difference between that and OLS. One argument for Ridge is that it will penalize complexity, while not making any of the features disappear; it might help me understand what the relative strength of the impacts of variables in my X dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) goes a step further from Ridge. LASSO uses the \"L1 penalty,\" which can set some coefficients to zero. I want to try running LASSO because I'm curious about what features it will make it disappear. LASSO is also good for situations with many features but it can struggle with high correlation, possibly discarding useful ones. So even before starting I'm thinking LASSO will be a good choice for the data as I have it configured.  I've also read that LASSO is best in medical contexts where interpretability is key. In general, I am a fan of interpretability, so I have a feeling I'll appreciate the LASSO output the most, although I have no idea if it will be the best in terms of accuracy."

    "The value of k in KNN involves some trade-offs: too small (like 1 or 2) and the model might get too sensitive to noise in the data, leading to overfitting. This could result in the model making decisions/predictions based on outliers rather than the overall trend. If k is too large, it's possible that important patterns in the data would get smoothed out (underfitting). A larger k can make the model more generalizable, but might miss important nuances. As an ML newbie I'm picking the standard 5. "

    "\"Bias\" refers to systematic errors that are created when a model tries to approximate real-world phenomena using a model that is too simple or just wrong; e.g. if the real-world relationship is non-linear, a linear model will create a lot of bias. \"Variance\" refers to the errors that are created when noisy data influences a model too much; unlike bias, where the model isn't precise or complex enough, variance means that the model is paying too much attention to the noise in the model and will perform poorly when confronted with a that dataset without the particular idiosyncracies it was trained on. The \"trade-off\" refers to the balance between the two.\n",

As you correct bias by adjusting the model, it's possible to make the model so sensitive that it picks up idiosyncracies/variance of the training set. At that point, the model will work well with the training set but not the test set. Our model shouldn't be so simple that it ignores things like age, sex, and race; but it can't be so specific that it adjusts itself to the specific dataset that we have available for training. "

The literature calls out the southeast as bine ghte \"diabetes belt\" so I'd definitely want to pay attention to that. My models didn't call out any particular regions, so I would indeed have to turn to the EDA and the literature for geographic prioritization.

I find this plausible; diabetes prevalence isn't really about race in a genetic/biological sense, but rather the way that race socially reflects underlying factors like socio-economic status and access to healthcare. I'd hopefully find data that highlights those associated factors to see how they play into the diabetes rates -- e.g. income, education, health insurance, the Medicaid model used by the state, and even available county health resources. Qualitatiive work with community members in high prevalence counties could help inform implementation choices too. These kinds of findings can be really sensitive, because they can be interpreted as blaming. We'd want to be careful and make sure we're not stigmatizing or labeling a demographic as unhealthy. \n",
